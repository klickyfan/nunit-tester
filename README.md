This is a simple test runner, built with [NUnit 3.0](https://github.com/nunit) and [NUnitLite](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/NUnitLite-Runner), that I created to explore/better understand aspects of how best to use these tools, such how to ensure that a`OneTimeSetUp` method is called before any `Test` method, or how to share data between a `SetUpFixture` class and a `TestFixture` class  or how to determine the names of test cases returned by `TestCaseSource` methods. 

Feel free to clone and use as you wish.
